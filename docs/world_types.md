# World Types (HeartOS)

This document fixes the world taxonomy so that environment differences are
designed as first-class inputs, not afterthoughts. The goal is to separate
"what the OS is" from "what the world teaches it."

## Core Principle

The same Σ-sovereign loop should develop different traits when placed in
different world types. Personality is not installed; it is shaped by how the
world constrains and permits recovery.
The same event may increase drive in one world type and reduce it in another,
depending on recovery guarantees and social structure.

## World Type 1: Survival (Non-Infrastructure)

- Resources: food / water are scarce.
- Danger: lethal and immediate.
- Recovery: slow and costly.
- Learning: fear and avoidance dominate.

Intended use: not a starter world. This is for validating hard constraints and
long recovery tails once the loop is stable.

## World Type 2: Community (Semi-Infrastructure)

- Resources: shared, negotiated.
- Danger: social and relational.
- Recovery: depends on others.
- Learning: trust and coordination shape behavior.

Intended use: introduce visible and invisible contribution dynamics.

## World Type 3: Infrastructure (Modern Baseline)

- Resources: assumed to exist.
- Danger: non-lethal, continuous.
- Recovery: fast and institutional.
- Learning: constraint management and selection.

Example: Commute. This is the safest entry point for validating Σ veto,
drive accumulation, and trace_v1 auditing.

## World Type 4: Abstract Capitalism

- Resources: represented as numbers.
- Danger: delayed, often invisible.
- Recovery: slow, feedback is lagged.
- Learning: meaning reconstruction under uncertainty.

Intended use: test whether the loop can preserve agency when contributions are
not directly observable.

## Cross-World Comparison (What to Observe)

- drive persistence vs recovery rate
- boundary span length
- veto timing (early vs late)
- trace coverage and auditability
- effective time horizon (short-term survival vs long-term optimization)

## Non-Negotiables

- Σ remains the final arbiter in every world type.
- World feedback changes inputs, not the decision authority.
- Coaching adds constraints; it does not override Σ.
- A single instance may transition between world types; accumulated traces must
  continue to constrain behavior after the transition.
