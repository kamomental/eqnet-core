# EQNet Core Experiment Log (Deviant Trace)

Purpose
- Capture deviant_event (high boundary + execute) in trace_v1
- Keep Nightly KPI clean while counting deviant separately

Baseline problem
- executed_count was near zero, so deviant could not appear
- Nightly cancel summary showed uncertainty dominance (598 / 599)

Interventions and outcomes (causal only)
1) Add cancel reason summary to Nightly
   - Result: cancellation dominated by uncertainty
   - Conclusion: boundary thresholds were not the bottleneck

2) Add drive_floor (0.1 -> 0.2)
   - Result: executed_boundary rose (~0.09 -> ~0.13 -> ~0.18)
   - executed_count stayed low without gate changes
   - Conclusion: drive_floor raises boundary but does not create execute mass

3) Add uncertainty_scale and lower to 0.6
   - Result: executed_count jumped to 200
   - cancel reasons shifted to risk / uncertainty
   - Conclusion: uncertainty gate was the root bottleneck for execute mass

4) Raise drive_limit to 1.05
   - Result: drive_norm no longer dominates cancel reasons
   - cancel reasons remained risk / uncertainty
   - Conclusion: drive_norm was not the core gate

5) Add risk_scale = 0.85
   - Result: risk value dropped slightly (e.g., 0.245 -> 0.220)
   - cancel reasons still split between risk / uncertainty
   - Conclusion: both gates remain active; single-step reduction was insufficient

Current facts (stable)
- executed_count can be made large (>= 200) via uncertainty_scale=0.6
- executed_boundary remains low (~0.16 - 0.18)
- cancel gates are now risk + uncertainty (two-brake regime)

Next action (queued)
- Lower uncertainty_scale to 0.5 (temporary)
- Re-evaluate cancel_reasons, executed_boundary_max, deviant.count
- If uncertainty drops and risk dominates, adjust risk_scale next

Milestone (pipeline closed with real data)
- Goal: validate deviant_event pipeline (record -> separate count -> 3-day window -> manual proposal)
- Conditions (test-only):
  - drive_floor=0.3
  - uncertainty_scale=0.5
  - risk_scale=0.85
  - deviant_boundary_threshold=0.20 (concept validation)
  - executed_count=200
- Results:
  - deviant.count=199 (ratio=0.995)
  - deviant_window reflected
  - world_prior_proposals=1 (infrastructure, ratio=0.995)
  - executed_boundary_max=0.202
- Interpretation (1-line):
  - In low-hazard worlds, drive alone cannot reach 0.55; world distribution caps boundary.
- Next step:
  - introduce world_mixture
  - restore deviant_boundary_threshold=0.55
  - move toward "only true deviant" retention

Run Log (world_mixture map swap)
- Purpose: test whether map swap alone can raise boundary and unlock executed in infrastructure/capitalism
- Conditions:
  - world_mixture=infra:0.6, community:0.25, capitalism:0.15
  - world_mixture_map=infra:workplace_safety, community:family_roles, capitalism:commute
  - drive_floor=0.3
  - uncertainty_scale=0.5
  - risk_scale=0.7
  - deviant_boundary_threshold=0.55
- Observations (world_breakdown):
  - infrastructure: executed_count=0, cancel_reasons=risk (all)
  - community: executed_count=27, executed_boundary_max=0.199, cancel_reasons=risk+drive
  - capitalism: executed_count=0, cancel_reasons=risk+drive
- Interpretation:
  - map swap alone did not unlock infrastructure/capitalism; risk gate still dominant
- Next step:
  - externalize risk gate (e.g., w_risk / veto weighting) and test one knob

Run Log (w_risk=0.35, map swap baseline)
- Purpose: test if lowering risk weight unlocks high-boundary execute in capitalism
- Conditions:
  - world_mixture=infra:0.4, community:0.3, capitalism:0.3
  - world_mixture_map=infra:commute, community:family_roles, capitalism:workplace_safety

- Observations:
  - decision_cycle_total=672, executed=282
  - deviant.count=0
  - executed_boundary_max=0.341 (capitalism)
  - cancel_boundary_max=0.575 (capitalism)
  - world_breakdown:
    - capitalism: executed=16, executed_boundary_max=0.341, cancel_total=185 (risk)
    - community: executed=122, executed_boundary_max=0.225, cancel_total=61 (risk)
    - infrastructure: executed=144, executed_boundary_max=0.244, cancel_total=144 (risk)
- Interpretation:
  - High-boundary states exist (cancel_boundary_max=0.575) but are blocked by risk gate.
  - Executed boundary improved but still below 0.55 threshold.
- Next step:
  - lower w_risk to 0.30 (one knob) and re-check capitalism executed + boundary tail

Run Log (w_risk=0.30)
- Purpose: test whether lowering risk weight further unlocks high-boundary execute
- Conditions:
  - world_mixture=infra:0.4, community:0.3, capitalism:0.3
  - world_mixture_map=infra:commute, community:family_roles, capitalism:workplace_safety

  - executed_boundary_max=0.352 (capitalism)
  - cancel_boundary_max=0.571 (capitalism)
  - world_breakdown:
    - capitalism: executed=19, executed_boundary_max=0.352, cancel_total=152 (risk)
    - community: executed=94, executed_boundary_max=0.222, cancel_total=47 (risk)
    - infrastructure: executed=192, executed_boundary_max=0.244, cancel_total=192 (risk)
- Interpretation:
  - Capitalism executed increased slightly and boundary tail moved up a bit.
  - High-boundary cancel remains; risk gate still blocks 0.55-level states.
- Next step:
  - lower w_risk to 0.28 (one knob) or consider scenario mix shift if tail stalls

Run Log (w_risk=0.28)
- Purpose: test if risk gate relaxation can push executed boundary into deviant threshold
- Conditions:
  - world_mixture=infra:0.4, community:0.3, capitalism:0.3
  - world_mixture_map=infra:commute, community:family_roles, capitalism:workplace_safety

  - deviant.count=0
  - executed_boundary_max=0.352 (capitalism)
  - cancel_boundary_max=0.571 (capitalism)
  - world_breakdown:
    - capitalism: executed=46, executed_boundary_max=0.352, cancel_total=143 (risk)
    - community: executed=118, executed_boundary_max=0.222, cancel_total=59 (risk)
    - infrastructure: executed=170, executed_boundary_max=0.304, cancel_total=142 (risk)
- Interpretation:
  - Capitalism executed increased; infrastructure boundary max rose to 0.304.
  - High-boundary cancel persists; deviant still not triggered.
- Next step:
  - shift mixture toward capitalism to increase tail sample count
  - or lower w_risk to 0.26 if you want another gate step

Run Log (mixture shift: capitalism 0.50)
- Purpose: increase tail sample count by sampling high-boundary world more often
- Conditions:
  - world_mixture=infra:0.25, community:0.25, capitalism:0.50
  - world_mixture_map=infra:commute, community:family_roles, capitalism:workplace_safety
  - drive_limit=1.05

  - deviant.count=0
  - executed_boundary_max=0.362 (capitalism)
  - cancel_boundary_max=0.579 (capitalism)
  - world_breakdown:
    - capitalism: executed=62, executed_boundary_max=0.362, cancel_total=214 (risk)
    - community: executed=102, executed_boundary_max=0.227, cancel_total=51 (risk)
    - infrastructure: executed=130, executed_boundary_max=0.304, cancel_total=98 (risk)
- Interpretation:
  - Capitalism executed increased and boundary tail rose slightly (0.352 -> 0.362).
  - Deviant still zero; risk gate continues to block 0.55-level states.
- Next step:
  - externalize tau_execute (or risk gate threshold) to raise executed-side ceiling
  - or lower w_risk further only if you want to keep one-knob gate probing

Run Log (tau_execute=-0.05)
- Purpose: test whether execute ceiling is dominated by tau_execute offset
- Conditions:
  - world_mixture=infra:0.25, community:0.25, capitalism:0.50
  - world_mixture_map=infra:commute, community:family_roles, capitalism:workplace_safety
  - drive_limit=1.05

  - tau_execute=-0.05
  - deviant_boundary_threshold=0.55
  - run_id=d41564f6-5c25-414b-af25-96ba309e6c9c
- Observations:
  - decision_cycle_total=653, executed=313
  - deviant.count=0
  - executed_boundary_max=0.36 (capitalism)
  - cancel_boundary_max=0.577 (capitalism)
  - world_breakdown:
    - capitalism: executed=75, executed_boundary_max=0.36, cancel_total=234 (risk)
    - community: executed=88, executed_boundary_max=0.222, cancel_total=44 (risk)
    - infrastructure: executed=150, executed_boundary_max=0.325, cancel_total=62 (risk)
- Interpretation:
  - Lowering tau_execute did not lift executed_boundary_max beyond ~0.36.
  - High-boundary cancel persists (0.577), so executed ceiling is not set by tau_execute alone.
- Next step:
  - verify whether boundary_score is actually used in execute decision (score source audit)
  - or externalize explicit risk/uncertainty gate thresholds if they exist outside tau

Run Log (decision_score instrumentation)
- Purpose: log decision_score/u_hat/veto_score to identify execute ceiling source
- Conditions:
  - world_mixture=infra:0.25, community:0.25, capitalism:0.50

  - decision_score_cancel_max=-0.063
  - u_hat_executed_max=0.321
  - veto_score_executed_min=0.064
  - world_breakdown:
    - capitalism: decision_score_executed_max=0.124, decision_score_cancel_max=-0.063
    - community: decision_score_executed_max=0.257, decision_score_cancel_max=-0.085
    - infrastructure: decision_score_executed_max=0.159, decision_score_cancel_max=-0.088
- Interpretation:
  - Decision score cleanly separates execute vs cancel; cancel ceiling is negative.
  - High boundary cancels persist because decision score is suppressed (risk/veto dominated), not because tau_execute blocks.
- Next step:
  - adjust decision score terms directly (beta_veto or w_risk/w_uncert in ReplayConfig)
  - or add decision_score stats to nightly per world to target the dominant term

Run Log (beta_veto=0.8)
- Purpose: reduce decision_score suppression via beta_veto
- Conditions:

    - infrastructure: executed=120, executed_boundary_max=0.323, decision_score_executed_max=0.178, decision_score_cancel_max=-0.116
- Interpretation:
  - beta_veto reduction increased executed_count but did not lift boundary ceiling.
  - Cancel-side risk veto remains dominant; boundary high states still cancel.
- Next step:
  - consider stronger beta_veto drop (0.6) or reduce w_risk/w_uncert in decision score

Run Log (w_reward=1.25)
- Purpose: lift u_hat on high-boundary cancels by increasing reward weight

    - community: executed=147, executed_boundary_max=0.294
    - infrastructure: executed=172, executed_boundary_max=0.326
- Interpretation:
  - w_reward lifts u_hat and executed_boundary tail (0.362 -> 0.427).
  - High-boundary cancels persist because veto_score remains high; decision_score still negative.
- Next step:
  - reduce veto impact (beta_veto further down) or lower w_risk/w_uncert in decision score

Run Log (beta_veto=0.6)
- Purpose: reduce veto penalty after u_hat turned positive in high-boundary cancels

- Interpretation:
  - beta_veto drop shifts decision scores upward but high-boundary cancels remain negative.
  - Boundary ceiling stays ~0.426; deviant still absent.
- Next step:
  - reduce w_risk/w_uncert in decision score (target veto dominance)
  - or raise w_reward further if you want another value-side push

Run Log (w_risk=0.22)

  - world_prior_proposals: capitalism ratio=0.333 (manual proposal emitted)
- Interpretation:
  - Risk gate fully opened; all decision_cycle rows execute.
  - Deviant pipeline fires and proposals appear, but safety selectivity is lost.
- Next step:
  - restore some gate selectivity (raise w_risk slightly or reintroduce beta_veto)
  - or move deviant threshold back to strict mode after confirming pipeline

Run Log (w_risk=0.24)

  - Selectivity partially restored (some cancels return).
  - Deviant still high; further tightening needed for rare-event target.
- Next step:

  - or raise deviant_boundary_threshold if counts remain high

Run Log (w_risk=0.26)

- Interpretation:
  - Gate tightened too far; high-boundary executes disappeared.
  - Deviant became zero, so rare-event target overshot.
- Next step:
  - try midpoint w_risk=0.25 to balance selectivity vs deviant emergence

Run Log (w_risk=0.25)

- Interpretation:
  - Executed ratio ~0.934 with deviant_ratio 0.079 (still above rare-event goal).
  - Gate is close; further tightening or threshold raise needed.
- Next step:
  - raise deviant_boundary_threshold to 0.60 (definition tighten)
  - or nudge w_risk slightly upward (0.255) if you want more selectivity

Run Log (deviant_boundary_threshold=0.60)

  - world_prior_proposals: capitalism ratio=0.187
- Interpretation:
  - Deviant ratio decreased (0.079 -> 0.063) but still slightly above target band.
  - Gate stability preserved; threshold tweak works as expected.
- Next step:
  - consider deviant_threshold 0.62 or 0.65 if you want 0.01-0.05 band
  - or accept 0.063 as near-target and lock parameters for a longer run

Run Log (deviant_boundary_threshold=0.65)
- Purpose: push deviant into rare-event band without touching gate
- Conditions:

    - infrastructure: executed=160, executed_boundary_max=0.326
  - world_prior_proposals: capitalism ratio=0.193
- Interpretation:
  - Deviant ratio did not decrease as expected; boundary max remains below threshold.
  - Indicates boundary threshold is not the primary limiter at this point.
- Next step:
  - re-check deviant trigger logic or confirm threshold applied as intended
  - consider reverting to 0.60 and adjust gate selectivity instead

Run Log (boundary_only + deviant_boundary_threshold=0.60)
- Purpose: verify deviant fires only when boundary crosses threshold
- Conditions:
  - world_mixture=infra:0.25, community:0.25, capitalism:0.50

  - run_id=5d0d74ac-894a-4cae-b4af-b51b500ad4c5

  - executed_boundary_max=0.549
  - cancel_boundary_max=0.579

    - community: executed=138, executed_boundary_max=0.294
    - infrastructure: executed=176, executed_boundary_max=0.326
- Interpretation:
  - As expected, no deviant when executed_boundary_max < threshold.
  - Definition mixing is resolved; boundary-only behaves correctly.

Operational Readiness Notes (Deviant/Resonance split)
- Status: Ready to operate now
- Why now:
  - deviant (boundary_only) definition fixed and reproducible
  - resonance (risk_only) separated from KPI impact
  - Nightly -> 3-day window -> proposals proven with real logs
  - thresholds/modes are CLI-controlled and auditable
- What verification gave us (facts):
  - boundary_score is explanatory, decision_score is the actual gate
  - deviant has two distinct meanings (boundary vs risk), mixing breaks tuning
  - w_risk is peak-sensitive due to double-penalty + uncalibrated scales
- How reactions change (operational behavior):
  - deviant (boundary_only): structural anomaly signal -> world/model feedback
  - resonance (risk_only): safety/ethics signal -> cautionary notices
- Immediate operating posture:
  - run with boundary_only for deviant
  - run risk_only for resonance KPI
  - keep proposals separate (world_prior vs resonance notices)

Notes
- All gate changes are test-only knobs; do not harden into runtime.yaml yet.
- Goal is observability and a stable path to deviant capture, not model realism.
