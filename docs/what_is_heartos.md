# What is HeartOS?

HeartOS is not an AGI and not a conversational agent.

It is a reference implementation of a Σ-sovereign loop where:
- decisions are vetoed by internal state,
- pain is accumulated over time,
- responsibility appears as intervention traces,
- and nightly audit preserves unresolved tension.

If you are looking for a demo, start elsewhere.
If you are looking for a system that survives its own mistakes,
start with `scripts/minimal_heartos_loop.py`.
