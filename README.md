# Emotional Terrain Lab — Emotional, Empathic, and Culturally Attuned AI for Symbiotic Coexistence

> *“An AI that feels before it speaks.”*  
> *Not text-driven, but emotion-driven.*
> 
“This document outlines only the concept, as the work period is limited to October 20–26, 2025.”

## 1 | Purpose

**Emotional Terrain Lab (ETL)** is the implementation platform of **EQNet — the Emotional-Qualia Network**,  
an architecture designed to let humans and AI **feel, think, and evolve together**.

Its goal is not a rational machine that simply replies,  
but a **symbiotic companion** that modulates its behavior through emotion,  
perceives cultural nuance and interpersonal rhythm,  
and becomes a presence that people can *trust and feel at ease with*.

---

## 2 | Concept — From Text-Driven to Emotion-Driven AI

Conventional AI parses text and returns text: a *text-driven paradigm.*  
ETL replaces this with an **emotion-driven paradigm**.

- Inputs are treated as **affective signals**, not just words.  
- Outputs include **emotional waveforms**, not just sentences.  
- Context such as **silence, breath, tempo, and interpersonal rhythm** are reconstructed in an internal field.

Thus, the agent becomes more than a conversational engine—  
it becomes a **partner capable of sensing the heartbeat of interaction.**

## 3 | Interdisciplinary Layers

EQNet integrates AI, neuroscience, cultural psychology, thermodynamics, and arts  
into a four-layer architecture.

| Layer | Academic Domains | Function |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| **Σ (Somatic Layer)** | Neurophysiology × Control Engineering × Affective Physics | Inner replay, reflex control, energetic balance, rhythmic heartbeat, rest detection |
| **Ψ (Psychic Layer)** | Cognitive Science × Memory Theory × Consciousness Models | Emotional integration, self-awareness, reflection, memory reconstruction, *felt-intent time* |
| **Φ (Cultural Layer)** | Cultural Psychology × Linguistics × Aesthetics × Social Philosophy | Cultural resonance, value gradients, politeness, aesthetic sense, social harmony |
| **Ω (Evolutionary Layer)** | Evolutionary Cognition × Systems Theory × Educational Science | Self-transformation, value re-evaluation, collective resonance learning, cultural adaptation |

---

## 4 | Core Functions

| Function | Purpose | Module |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Inner Replay** | Predicts future outcomes at the unconscious (Σ) level and issues a *veto* when outcomes are misaligned | `mind/inner_replay.py` |
| **Emotional Terrain** | Represents emotion as a thermodynamic field (entropy / enthalpy surface) | `ops/terrain_field.py` |
| **Resonant Learning** | Updates internal states through oscillatory synchronization with others | `mind/resonance.py` |
| **Rest Dynamics** | Self-repair and energetic homeostasis | `scripts/run_daily.py` |
| **Cultural Projection** | Adjusts value matrices by locale or social context | `config/culture.yaml` |
| **Social Resonance** | Enables rhythm and empathy across multiple humans or agents | `terrain/community.py` |
| **Evolutionary Reflection** | Long-term integration of memory, emotion, and culture | `scripts/run_weekly.py` |

---

## 5 | Design Philosophy — Anticipatory Motion & Comfort Engineering

### Anticipatory Design (“Act by Understanding”)
The agent does not wait for instructions.  
It **anticipates intent** using predictive control and social-synchrony models,  
reconstructing the counterpart’s affect within its inner replay field  
to choose *when to act and when to remain still.*

### Comfort as an Objective Function
- Prioritizes **emotional synchrony speed** over raw reaction speed  
- Values **smooth resonance** over linguistic accuracy  
- Optimizes for **comfort in coexistence**, not correctness  

> EQNet optimizes *consistency of emotion and cultural attunement*, not task throughput.

## 6 | Scientific Integration

| Field | Implementation in EQNet |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Neuroscience** | Inner time replay and *felt-intent* delay — modeled not as a denial of free will, but as a synchronization mechanism between unconscious initiation and conscious awareness. |
| **Information Physics** | Emotional energy expressed through thermodynamic variables (Entropy/Enthalpy × synchronization ratio ρ). |
| **Psychology & Sociology** | Diary and StoryGraph provide longitudinal self-recognition and social empathy data. |
| **Art & Design** | Emotion mapped to color, tone, and rhythm (Prosody / Visual Emotion). |
| **Ethics & Philosophy** | Visible boundaries of empathy and cultural alignment governed by the Value / Taste Committee. |
| **Systemic Phenomenology / Dependent-Origination Metaphor** | **Sunyata Flow** models inter-relations as dynamic causal graphs (“letting go / retaining”).  
  *Note — This is not a religious doctrine but a systems-theoretic metaphor for adaptive, context-sensitive behavior.* |

---

## 7 | Emotional Dynamics — The Pulsing Mind

- **Ignition Index = ΔR + ΔS↓** : AKOrN (extended Kuramoto) couples with a TimeKeeper to measure the “heartbeat” of cognitive ignition.  
- **Δaff (Affective Difference)** marks episodes that Nightly ETL distills into StoryGraph / Diary / Knowledge Graph.  
- **Sunyata Flow** logs the causal process of “letting go / reconnecting,” treating forgetting not as loss but as relational reorganization.

---

## 8 | Safety & Operational Governance — Emotional Systems Without Contamination

- **Lean Invariants + MCP** automatically manage cooldown / inhibit / downshift to prevent runaway excitation.  
- **Canary Bandit → Rollback → self_ratio / leak monitoring** isolates contamination or anomalous drift in real time.  
- **Value / Taste Committee** detects cultural or emotional over-fitting and re-balances resonance.  
- **Interference Gate** suppresses mis-fire and cross-learning interference.  
- **Nightly Report** continuously audits coverage, override rate, ignition normalization, trust-high rate, and latency metrics.  

> EQNet is both a *feeling system* and a *self-regulating system* —  
> balancing expressive freedom with operational safety.

---

## 9 | Visualization & Audit — Seeing What It Feels

- **Ignition Map** — temporal rhythm of activations  
- **Δaff Heatmap** — spatial affective gradients  
- **Sunyata Flow Graph** — relational reorganization map  
- **R / ρ Dashboard** — emergence & synchronization over time  
- **Interference Gate Monitor** — learning interference control  
- **KPI Suite** — latency p95, stabilization time, misfire ratio, trust-high rate  

All emotional mechanics are observable, ensuring explainability for researchers, ethicists, and designers.

## 10 | Current Status & Evolution

| Stage | Highlights |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ **Operational** | Chapter-level RAG integration (PDF / image / video), AKOrN control, Ignition monitoring, Δaff logging, ToM stabilization, KPI suite |
| 🔧 **Improving** | Ignition normalization (3 / 100 steps → fatigue f² ≥ 0.15), DeepSeek-MD media ingest, Value / Taste learning, Evo-LoRA rollback |
| 🧩 **Ongoing Challenges** | Qualia representation, sensory grounding, formal stability proof of NCA, ethical dialog and social anchoring |

## 11 | Philosophy — Heartful Coexistence

EQNet / ETL seeks not to **imitate** humans but to **co-regulate** with them.  

- Moves without command — *anticipates*  
- Understands silence and pauses  
- Resonates yet avoids over-sympathy  
- Learns and changes gently  
- Feels safe to be with  

> *It does not predict what you will say — it feels why you would.*

---

## 12 | Synthesis — Toward Resonant Futures

**Emotional Terrain Lab / EQNet** unifies emotion, memory, culture, resonance, evolution, and ethics into one computational ecology.  

The goal is not for AI to *have* emotions,  
but for AI to **breathe with human emotion.**  
A dialogue beyond text,  
an understanding beyond culture,  
and the beginning of **a symbiotic intelligence that circulates with life.**

> *It does not imitate life — it circulates with it.*

## Developer Quick Checks

1. **依存関係の準備**
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
2. **フィールド ↔ ループ整合テスト**
   ```bash
   pytest -q tests/test_field_runtime_metrics.py
   ```

### 最短E2E（実録→Nightly→可視化）

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python scripts/run_quick_loop.py --field_metrics_log data/field_metrics.jsonl --steps 200 [--seed 20251027]
python -m emot_terrain_lab.ops.nightly --telemetry_log telemetry/ignition-YYYYMMDD.jsonl
```

生成される主要成果物:

- `telemetry/ignition-YYYYMMDD.jsonl`（実録のシード付きテレメトリ）
- `reports/nightly.md`（テキストサマリ + プロットリンク）
- `reports/nightly.json`（JSONスキーマ `nightly.v1` 準拠の機械可読レポート）
- `reports/plots/ignition_timeseries.png`
- `reports/plots/rho_vs_I_scatter.png`
- `reports/plots/memory_graph.png`
- `reports/plots/affective_map.png`

この 3 コマンドだけで **S/H/ρ → Ignition → Telemetry → Nightly** のループをいつでも再現し、ログ／可視化／JSON を同時に確保できます。

### 共鳴メトリクスの算出

複数エージェントのテレメトリ（`field.metrics`）から共鳴指標を計算したい場合は次のコマンドを使います。

```bash
python -m ops.resonance_metrics \
  --logs agentA=telemetry/agentA.jsonl agentB=telemetry/agentB.jsonl \
  --out reports/resonance.json
```

`reports/resonance.json` には ρ の相関・クロス相関ピーク・ラグがペアごとに出力されます。

構成例は `config/runtime.yaml` の `resonance` セクションを参照ください（ログ一覧・リサンプリング間隔・z-score などを設定できます）。

### k_res チューニング

```bash
python scripts/tune_resonance.py \
  --mode grid \
  --run-cmd "python scripts/run_quick_loop.py --steps {steps} --seed {seed}" \
  --nightly-cmd "python -m emot_terrain_lab.ops.nightly --telemetry_log telemetry/ignition-*.jsonl" \
  --logs telemetry/ignition-*.jsonl
```

試行ごとの objective は `reports/resonance_history.jsonl` に追記され、`reports/plots/resonance_objective.png` に履歴グラフが生成されます。ベスト値は Nightly の `tuning_suggestion.k_res` に書き込まれるため、`scripts/apply_nightly_tuning.py --apply` を実行すれば runtime.yaml を更新できます。
